# neo_pas
Pascal game framework for MS-DOS

Code is intended to work with Turbo Pascal.

Code is meant to compile in FPC compaibility mode (-mfpc). (NOT objfpc).
 - This ensures integers are 16-bit

Note: We could probably use TP compatibility for non-DOS targets if we're willing to sacrifice inline procedures.
